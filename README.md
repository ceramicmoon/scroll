**MagicScroll** is a quick minimalist chatroom/text-conferencing system for mathematicians (or anyone in a mathematics-intensive profession) designed to resolve the existing inconvenience in temporary, private and professional communications online. It provides a minimalistic, straightforward and distraction-free group messaging interface, as well as a dedicated shared whiteboard for each room on the server, which can be privately shared by the user. The system features instant accountless usability, full Markdown support including common syntax highlighting schemes and in-place $\LaTeX$ rendering (with [KaTeX](https://github.com/Khan/KaTeX))

*The official service is now temporarily discontinued in 2025 due to server migration after successfully running on its previous server for over 1 year. We are planning to restore the service in 2026, but you are always free to deploy on your own server when the need arises. We currently expect to bring it back in Spring 2026.*

## TODO
- [ ] Add a detailed project structure documentation
- [ ] Improve interactive help features
- [ ] Migrate to a new fully integrated whiteboard system (subject to server availability)
